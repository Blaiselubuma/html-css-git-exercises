          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            In the 1870s, the telegraphic specialist, <strong>Elisha Gray</strong>, conducted
            research to transmit simultaneously several messages on the same line of the telegraph
            (invented in 1837), using alternating and non-continuous current, research that would
            lead to the invention the phone. At the same time, American-born speech-language
            pathologist
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell" target="_blank"
              >Graham Bell</a
            >
            did almost identical work and was the first to patent the invention of the voice
            transmission system. Thus, on March 10, 1876, Graham Bell succeeded in the first
            transmission on electric wires of a voice message, to a room on another floor, where his
            assistant <strong>Thomas Watson</strong> was standing, a phrase still famous: "Mr.
            Watson, come here, I need you! "

            The traditional wired telephony uses several techniques, the first is the modulation at
            low frequencies (vocal frequencies) of a carrier current on a two-wire line. The second,
            the power supply by a central battery and the third is that of the switched lines.
